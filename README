lake (c) 2009 -- Andrew Stine

Lake is a simple bash script to help manage Common Lisp libraries.
It's primary purpose is that of the 'soft install,' that is, of
simply putting links to library .asd files and letting ASDF do
the rest. As opposed to other tools, such as ASDF-Install,
The Common Lisp Controller, and clbuild, Lake does not attempt
to perform dependency checking or replace your curent build setup;
instead, it attempts to fit in to your current setup and simplify
the process of installing libraries manually, and maintaining
libraries created or hacked by the user.

To install type 'make.' To uninstall type 'make uninstall.'

USAGE:
lake <options> <action> <target>

options:
   -h - print help and leave
   --lisp - name of lisp implementation to install for
   --lisp-home - home directory of lisp implementation
   --asf-registry - where asdf looks for asd files and symlinks

actions:
   soft-install - install by linking asd files in the asdf registry

targets:
   must be either a directory, tarball, or downloadable link

EXAMPLES:
   lake soft-install lisp-library/
   lake soft-install lisp-library.tar.gz
   lake soft-install http://common-lisp.net/project/lisp-library/lisp-library.tar.gz
